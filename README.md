ANGSD Final Project 

This is an analysis pipeline for the GEO Series GSE153485. 

The CSV in CSV/ is a custom made file necessary to run this pipeline. 

All scripts in scripts/ consist of a shell script and an sbatch script to run said shell script. The order for the sbatch scripts are on the end of those scripts, for example '_01', '_02', etc. 

The only exception to this is that there are 2 shell scripts to run STAR alignment and RSeQC, one normal, and one to run in parallel. The script you would like to use needs to be selected
in the corresponding sbatch script. This is commented at the bottom of those sbatch scripts. 

The QC/ folder contains all QC files generated by the pipeline except for STAR logs. The most up to date featureCounts is designated '149' and the most up to date multiQC is 'multiQC_2'.

The only FastQC abd RSeQC files contained in this directory are the most recent.
